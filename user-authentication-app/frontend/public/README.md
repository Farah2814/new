# Content writing website
#### Description:

I would begin the introduction of my project by defining my profession. I am a content writer. I create written material for various mediums such as websites, blogs, social media, and other digital platforms. 

I took this project as an opportunity to develop a website for myself that features my professional work. A website is important for a content writer for several reasons:

For showcasing portfolio and expertise, for building credibility and professionalism, for attracting clients and job opportunities, for showcasing a personal brand, for publishing and sharing content and for networking and collaboration.

Implementation of sessions for user authentication.

# Limitations:
Although the website attained its objectives, but there were some inevitables.  I wanted to make it more interactive and responsive but due to time constraints I was not able to do so. I also aimed to work more on the backend part, to store the subscription from the newaletter, and to store the orders in the data base, however, due to time constraint and personal reason, I am unabble to do so.
